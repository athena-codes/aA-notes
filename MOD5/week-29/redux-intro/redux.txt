 ** REDUX INTRO NOTES **

 -- Store global info in a more organized manner than React Context,
 useful for large scale apps.

 USEFUL REDUX COMPONENTS: 

 -- Store
  - redux stores state in a single store

-- Actions
  - how we update stores/state
  - dispatched with an object to update
  - reducer is invoked with said action

-- Thunks
  - thunk is where fetches to API are made
  - thunk is used to make API call, dispatch is invoked
    with the action and the reducer invokes the action
  - update state based on what was tossed into the reducer function
  - async fetch -> dispatch action -> data sent to reducer to update state
